# Design-a-StackOverflow-Post

**Breif**: Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. It have properties for title, description and the date/time at which the blogpost was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. In the main method, i create a post, up-vote and down-vote then display the the current vote value. I did not give the ability to set the Vote property from the outside, because otherwise, you may accidentally change the votes of a class to 0 or to a random number. The class should always protect its state and hide its implementation detail.

**Educational tip**: The aim of this exercise is to help that classes should encapsulate data AND behaviour around that data.
